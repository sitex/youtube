00:06.657 --> 00:34.973
There are a lot of questions that have come in. One question is that we give water to the sun. I don't have blind faith. The question is how do we get it? Does it happen or not? This seems like a good question.

00:38.112 --> 01:04.927
Do you offer water? Yes, we do. How many people offer water? Raise your hands. It is everyone's job. Do you offer water? Do they get it? How do they get it? Water falls where you drop it. Then how does it go to them? Tell me.

01:05.146 --> 01:29.007
What, what? After offering? Here you go. Bhushan says that if you offer water, it is Vaspi Karan. That's a good thing. Vaspi Karan also happens.

01:30.931 --> 01:58.302
This is a good thing, not a bad thing. There is another question. When we chant mantras, we can hear the mantra or the name of God, but we cannot see Him.

02:00.293 --> 02:20.290
Do they listen or not? And what we do, how can we do it better? The question is good or not? Some intelligent man has written it. First let's deal with Suraj Bhagwan. Okay?

02:22.501 --> 02:30.668
Namo Bhaskaraya Devaya

02:30.837 --> 02:55.981
Devaya Prakasam Svarupakam Namastupyam Divakarah Namo Namaha

02:56.538 --> 03:26.002
Surya Narayan Bhagavan Ki Jai Bhagavan Surya Ko Jal Dena Aur Yaha Se Bhagavan Surya Ki Doori Kitne Laakh Mile Hai Samajh Rahe Hain Na Aur Unko Prapt Ho Jana

03:27.284 --> 03:54.402
It feels as if you are chewing on an iron bar. If you chew on an iron bar, your teeth will end. But the bar will not end. Do you understand? Now, how true is it that we,

03:55.229 --> 04:23.765
They offer water to God, and he receives that water. Look, there is blind faith, but this is not blind faith. Many people are against this,

04:27.005 --> 04:56.789
It's like blind faith. But I am the one who gives. Do you understand? So I will support you. Do you understand? Now look at water and sun. How do they connect?

04:56.958 --> 05:25.932
This is nature. In nature, five elements are the main elements. How many elements are there? Five. Five elements. And in the five elements, in the Ramayana, Sri Goswami Dasi Maharaj has written,

05:27.215 --> 05:54.130
Chitral pavak nagana Sameera Chitral pavak nagana Sameera Chitral pavak nagana Sameera

05:54.232 --> 05:58.433
Panjara jeetaiyaha

06:19.544 --> 06:39.406
PANCH TATVA SE DEHA BANA HAI PANCH TATVA SE DEHA BANA HAI PANCH TATVA SE

06:40.030 --> 07:06.018
In five, there is life in this world In five, there is life in this world In five, there is life

07:08.903 --> 07:30.875
What do you mean?

07:42.299 --> 08:11.948
And our Gurudev said, Child, everything is contained in these five elements. One is the body, and all the things that are in this nature, all of them, from these five elements,

08:12.927 --> 08:42.357
are created and are integrated in the five elements. Now, these five elements, the body is created, but these five elements are destroyed. They don't exist, they are lost. Like the prince,

08:43.538 --> 09:04.025
You dig up the soil, you make a pit, you drink tea and milk and throw it away. Then it becomes soil. But that soil, these five elements keep coming together, keep breaking apart, but those five elements never get destroyed.

09:52.709 --> 09:52.945
you

10:25.109 --> 10:46.321
Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram

11:05.558 --> 11:35.258
This Pancha Tattva that we have

11:36.338 --> 12:05.667
How is this possible? Like a potter... You all know about clay pots, right? A potter goes to the fields... ...and digs soft clay and brings it back. He makes a pot, a potter, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot, a potter's pot,

12:07.912 --> 12:35.317
And it breaks again, and again in the soil. There is a saying of Kabir Saheb. It is written in it. The soil says to the potter, The soil says to the potter, Why do you cry?

12:35.637 --> 13:01.945
One day it will come like this, if I let it be. You understand, right? The same soil, which the kumar brings, and makes everything like a machine, and then it gets mixed in it. Just like that.

13:02.907 --> 13:29.755
There is a prince who creates mankind. Who is he? A prince. In this universe, there are 8.4 million different forms of creation. The 8.4 million who are in the process of discovering science, have reached near and far.

13:30.667 --> 13:57.937
But Baba told me, child... The next part of the child...

13:59.118 --> 14:28.430
and then divide it by a hundred, and then divide it by a thousand. Such a subtle being is born, which cannot be seen with any instrument. Such a subtle being is born. Now, for such a subtle being, such an instrument has not yet been made.

14:31.433 --> 15:01.117
84 lakh srishti hai aur anand ki baat hai ki sabhi srishti ekdum sucharu roop se chal raha hai kahi koi kami nahi hai toh jaise kumhar ka banaya hua vartan nasht ho ke viti mein mil jata hai aise hi

15:01.893 --> 15:21.907
A saint once said, Ek kumara bet ke angan, ek kumara bet

15:30.192 --> 15:52.518
Mithi jaak chala weh Mithi jaak chala weh Mithi jaak chala weh Mithi jaak chala weh Lai lai paani haan toh tere Lai lai paani haan

16:05.950 --> 16:28.917
Kumbhara bheka aise hi kumbhara bheka aise hi

16:36.697 --> 17:00.288
Nara Nari Ke Ang Di Milte Julte Ho Jaati Hai Milte Julte Ban Jaati Hai

17:15.172 --> 17:43.724
Sadhguru chants Sanskrit chants

17:45.563 --> 17:54.018
It is very difficult to survive.

19:34.694 --> 19:57.863
Ram bhaj, Ram bhaj, Ram bhaj, pyaare. Ram bhaj, Ram bhaj, Ram bhaj, pyaare. Tum Sri Ram ji ke Ram ji tumhare. Tum Sri Ram ji ke Ram ji tumhare. Tum Sri Ram ji ke Ram ji tumhare. Tum Sri Ram ji ke Ram ji tumhare.

20:08.410 --> 20:16.358
Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram

20:51.779 --> 21:19.184
Vanadas has also said, Two kinds of soil meet. Both move together. And eat each other. Become a man-woman.

21:22.222 --> 21:51.095
The union of a man and a woman creates two types of soil. Both of them keep moving in the same direction. When they meet, they eat each other and form a universe. Do you understand? Science says that both are mucous. Mucous means Kapha. Kapha is like your TV. Some people have a watch on it.

21:51.652 --> 22:20.710
TV insects. In the same way, in a sperm, there is a living being. That living being and the mother's living being meet. The mother's living being eats the male living being. What does it do? It eats. And after eating, we become God.

22:21.740 --> 22:44.150
It is his creation. Do you understand? It is his wonderful creation. The poet said that Ramji's creation is wonderful. It is difficult to escape from it. That's why don't fall in love too much, don't get lost in the search too much. The poet said directly, just do Ram Ram.

22:45.584 --> 23:15.082
And the day you start chanting Ram, Ram, Ram, and become Ram, you will begin to understand His creation. And the day you begin to understand His creation, you will begin to experience His grace. So this soil, this soil is a wonderful thing.

23:17.680 --> 23:43.972
Out of these five elements, the most important element in the universe is water. What is water? It is 75% in our body and in this earth. After that, the second element is fruit. What is fruit?

23:46.452 --> 24:14.853
which is also present in our body. What is Thal? It is a bone. A bone is a mountain in the universe. What is it? A mountain. And Thal is flesh, soil. And what comes on the third number? Water. Soil. And what comes on the third number? Air.

24:16.203 --> 24:45.751
Let's put the air on the third number. Understood? Now, the air. Water is 70-75%. Divide that by earth. And divide that by air. And divide that by fire. And divide that by

24:49.987 --> 25:18.016
This is also too much. It is less than that. Understood? So, in this way. Now, this is the method of the creation of our body. Now, in this, the sky element has come. And where is the sun? In the sky.

25:19.737 --> 25:43.632
This is something to listen to carefully. There shouldn't be any mistake in this, or else your water will remain here. The Sun God won't take it. The sky is the lowest element. And where does the Sun God reside? In the sky. And who orders you to offer water?

25:46.602 --> 26:11.358
Aakash Tattva. Please pay attention. Which Tattva is it? Aakash Tattva. Aakash Tattva is our body. Whatever we do, our hands are moving, our tongue is moving, and there is something else going on in the mind.

26:11.459 --> 26:41.395
The heart is also beating, the liver is also moving, everything is moving. All these are the karmas of the Akash tattva. In that tattva, in that tattva, the Akash tattva is in the head. Where is it? In the head. And the Sun God is also in the head. Did you understand? In the same way, there is a layer in the Sanrasana, there is water below,

26:41.851 --> 27:11.568
The earth, the air, the fire, and above all, the sky. So the sky is the element that gives us the command to move. Today we didn't give water, we didn't drink water. Let's go and get some water. Secondly, all the mantras, etc., where do they originate from? From the sky.

27:13.019 --> 27:40.205
And where are the lanes? In the Akash Tattva. You understand, right? So who gave the order? The Akash Tattva. Who said the mantra? The Akash Tattva. And? At the behest of the Akash Tattva, we got the pot, the water, and the Akash Tattva supported the Akash Tattva.

27:44.069 --> 28:13.600
Samrat ke nahin kuchh gosai. Samrat ke nahin kuchh gosai. Ravi pavak surat sari ke nahin. Ravi pavak surat sari ke nahin.

28:14.984 --> 28:34.745
Samrat ke nahin udbe gosai Rabi pavak sun sari

28:45.815 --> 29:12.275
Samrath ke nahi dosa kosa hai. Rabi me tej, agan savroop hai. Rabi me tej, agan savroop hai.

29:14.620 --> 29:43.477
Agni savroop hai Agni suraj tez ji Agni suraj tez ji

29:50.918 --> 30:19.606
Dono hi ek jaise hote hai Dono hi ek jaise hote hai

30:20.011 --> 30:43.265
Veda Veda Veda Veda Veda Veda

30:48.901 --> 30:50.909
Oh.

31:43.812 --> 31:44.588
Yeah, man.

32:50.502 --> 33:15.680
Agni and Surj both are one and the same. There is not much difference between them. So, the sky element has given an order. To whom? To the body. To whom did it give the order? To the body. What did it give the order? To climb the water.

33:17.688 --> 33:43.793
Akash tattva ne aadesh diya sareen ko haath tayaar hua haath ne lota pakda akash tattva ne aadesh diya jal ko kisko? jal ko bhi aadesh diya jal lote miya yaa haath ko isse bana liya naddi me naha rahe hai aur jal charahane lage

33:43.996 --> 34:11.570
yehi surje sahastranso tejo rasi jagat pate anukam payama mahatta granarga divartarah

34:13.156 --> 34:38.738
Slowly, slowly, I am reciting the mantra. The water is like a stream. This is the way to offer water. When your stream falls, the sun touches the stream. The sun is visible in front of you. The stream touches it and goes down. You understand, right?

34:39.953 --> 35:07.915
When this happens, the mantra is the power of the sky, and the power of the sky has given the order, and the power of the sky is carrying it. Water falls on the earth, or if it falls from the roof, it goes to the roof.

35:08.185 --> 35:32.080
By going through the roof and searching for the way, one can even find the gutters. Now, Goswami ji has said, It is not the ability that is at fault, but the fault is the anger. Rabi pavak sur sari ki, Rabi pavak sur sari.

35:32.401 --> 36:01.004
Ravi means Sun, Pavak means fire and Sursari means Ganga. In Gangaji, how many rivers, streams, everything is there, but Ganga. Ganga is there, but always, the husband is a wanderer. Similarly,

36:01.814 --> 36:28.662
ek agni aapke ghar mein bhojan bana raha hai dusri agni mein swaha om namo narayanaya swaha om namo narayanaya dusri agni mein yagya ho raha hai aur vahi agni tisri jagah mein

36:29.590 --> 36:55.915
Chita ko zala rahi. Samajh rahe hain? Ek hi agni, alag alag jaga pe, alag alag pariyog mein liya jaa raha hai. Aise hi ek hi surya, jal pe bhi pad raha hai.

36:56.489 --> 37:21.717
He is making everything dry. What is He doing? He is making everything dry. He makes everything dry only when He will exploit the water. Why is anything wet? Because it contains water. That is why it is said,

37:22.392 --> 37:50.017
The same fire burns the pyre, but we bow to it. The fire worships God. In the same way, everyone goes to Ganga-ji, Yamuna-ji is also found in Ganga-ji. All the rivers and streams are found, we bow to them. The same is the case with God and the sun. Everyone is a customer.

37:51.586 --> 38:20.155
The river, the canal, the goods, the urine, all the things that have water, they exploit them all. That is why we say that they are capable. What are they? They are capable and they do not feel guilty. The water that you give them, they also exploit it in the same way.

38:23.227 --> 38:49.433
And when we chant mantras, we say mantras, at that time, through the sound of the mantra, water, the mantra itself is attained by them. The water falls there itself. The water is later absorbed. The mantra attains them. And this,

38:50.412 --> 39:20.045
With this kind of science, today's materialistic science is also surprised that how big an investment it is, how big a science is hidden in it. Today's scientists are not able to understand. They are searching, they are reaching, but not so deeply.

39:23.318 --> 39:52.698
So this is also a science. What is it? Science, discovery. All the mantras, what are they? They are all discoveries. So in this way, the water that we give to the Sun God, He gets it. There is no doubt about it. And water should be given.

39:59.903 --> 40:27.241
Let me tell you one more thing. In which pot do we give more water to the sun god? In the copper pot. Why do we give it in the copper pot? The steam has become very famous these days. You don't know, do you? When the sun god comes out, what colour does he appear? He doesn't appear in the colour of copper. You understand, don't you?

40:28.827 --> 40:56.468
Tamra is in colour, and the colour of the Tamra and the colour of the Sun are the same. And as soon as the Sun's rays fall on that pot, a connection is formed between the Tamra and the Sun. What is formed? A connection. And the Sun immediately accepts it.

41:00.147 --> 41:29.206
Do you understand? Similarly, fire. In the Vedas, the color of fire is also called tamravarna. Do you understand? Tamravarna. In this way, there are many things that we don't know about, but we do. And it is successful. There is no doubt about it.

41:30.218 --> 41:56.915
There is a lot to offer, one bucket at a time. One bowl will do the trick. If you are comfortable, keep chanting mantras and offering water. And we don't go out to offer water. We bathe in the river.

41:57.860 --> 42:27.796
This is how we make it. Like this. Like this. The anal is falling. And from where it is, we chant. We put our hand down. The water is gone. Where did it go? In the hand. Now, after that, wherever the water goes, our responsibility is over. You understand?

42:28.454 --> 42:57.310
When I watered it, it came back to me. I don't have any problem with that. When I water it, I think of the rising sun. Which one? God, Lord Hanuman, had the same problem. Do you understand?

42:58.289 --> 43:26.470
Naradakta Varnaam. Amra Varnaam. So, in this way, the water that is given to Bhagwan Surya, reaches him. What does it mean to reach? He takes it by the hand. Give it to me, brother. What's the hurry? You understand, right? Because it's a mantra. Now I'll tell you the second one. Jagat Sarvam Daivadhinam.

43:27.128 --> 43:55.462
mantrādhīnasya devatā te mantrā brāhmaṇādhīnaṁ tasmāta brāhmaṇadevatā And we, the sadhus, are for all this. We say, jagat sarvam daivādhīnam mantrādhīnasya devatā

43:56.288 --> 44:25.837
Now the world, this whole world, is under the control of God. God means Ishwar. God, who created it. And that Ishwar is under whose control?

44:27.001 --> 44:51.655
Mantra ke aadheen. Kis ke aadheen? Mantra ke aadheen. Aur woh mantra kis ke aadheen hai? Jo uska jaap karta hai. Aap samajh gaye? Woh mantra aapke aadheen hai. Kyonki aap jaapak hai.

44:53.815 --> 45:22.267
Jagat Sarvam Daivadhinam Mantra Dhinasya Devata De Mantra Jaap Ka Dhinam And the one who chants, when he chants mantras, you have the quality of being a deity. Which quality of being a deity? Being a deity. You understand, right? At that time,

45:23.178 --> 45:42.719
Devatva Kunalata. So now see, Jagat Sarvam Daiva Dhinan and Mantra Dhinascha, Surya Bhagwan's Mantra is being said. You are in the possession of that Mantra. And the time when you chant the Mantra while giving water,

45:43.310 --> 46:11.373
We take it, there is no doubt about it. In this way, Bhagwan Suraj takes your water. No matter how far apart we are, He still takes it. That is, no matter how far apart we are, He still comes close.

46:13.904 --> 46:42.558
Do you understand? The poet said... Where do people look for me? I am with you. Where do people look for me? I am with you. Where do people look for me? I am with you.

46:43.486 --> 47:10.182
mo ko kaha dhunde pyaare main toh tere paath main main toh tere paath main main toh tere paath main main toh tere paath main main toh tere paath main mo ko kaha dhunde pyaare

47:16.240 --> 47:40.912
Namaya Mandir Namaya Masjida

47:48.708 --> 48:16.383
Namahe Mandir, Namahe Masjid. Namahe Mandir, Namahe Masjid. Nakabe Kailasme, Nakabe Kailasme. Nakabe Kailasme, Nakabe Kailasme.

48:38.978 --> 48:39.333
Yeah.

49:11.463 --> 49:31.004
I am in your faith. I am in your faith.

50:21.292 --> 50:22.793
It's so good!

51:14.650 --> 51:15.713
Jai Jai Ram

51:47.438 --> 51:55.808
Siddhanta.

52:21.847 --> 52:38.873
Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram

54:20.832 --> 54:47.630
In this way, do not doubt the water of the Sun God. Today your doubt is solved. It should be complete. Because doubt is the soul's destruction. The scripture says that the work done in doubt is not successful.

54:50.161 --> 54:52.625
So, don't be in doubt.
