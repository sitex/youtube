00:00.188 --> 00:03.349
A child from Baba's family has asked a question.

00:03.349 --> 00:10.932
After death, should the body be donated to a doctor, or should it be given to Agni, or should it be buried in the ground?

00:10.932 --> 00:13.574
This is a very good question.

00:13.574 --> 00:15.174
After death, there is no existence of the body.

00:15.174 --> 00:16.675
This is the truth.

00:16.675 --> 00:19.376
But after death, if the body is cremated,

00:29.760 --> 00:32.981
That is also not considered right.

00:32.981 --> 00:40.022
In such a situation, if you have to donate, then do it while you are alive.

00:40.022 --> 00:43.343
After death, everything becomes late.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.623
What will you do while you are alive?

00:45.623 --> 00:49.824
Someone asked Baba, Baba said, Child, what is called Netra Daan?

00:49.824 --> 00:51.965
To give the eyes to someone else.

00:53.105 --> 00:56.090
It is not necessary that you donate your eyes.

00:56.090 --> 00:59.595
If you have the ability, consult a doctor.

00:59.595 --> 01:05.384
If a blind person needs medicine or has an eye problem, get it treated.

01:05.384 --> 01:07.507
This is also a donation of the eyes.

01:09.089 --> 01:15.650
Similarly, you can donate any organ of the body.

01:15.650 --> 01:20.431
In our Sanatan culture, donation is very important.

01:20.431 --> 01:25.332
In the past, people have donated.

01:25.332 --> 01:33.733
Our great sage, Dadhichi Rishi, who donated his ashes, there is such a description in the scriptures.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.914
He said, when I become Samadhi, my body,

01:38.094 --> 01:39.575
I will become Brahman.

01:45.553 --> 01:50.357
Take away the flesh from the body, take away the ashes and make a bhajra out of it.

01:50.357 --> 01:56.102
Give it to Indra and give him the boon of Vritrashtra.

01:56.102 --> 01:58.003
So, there is a way to donate the body.

01:58.003 --> 02:01.806
You can donate the whole body, but with knowledge, not without knowledge.

02:01.806 --> 02:03.548
You can meditate a little,

02:10.693 --> 02:11.174
Be determined.

02:11.174 --> 02:18.558
And like a wise man, if you attain God and your body becomes useful to someone, then that is good because every living being's body becomes useful.

02:18.558 --> 02:25.543
There are beautiful birds, people pick their feathers and put them in their houses, in their ponds, some even in their foreheads.

02:32.947 --> 02:39.733
Even Lord Krishna has put Mayur Pankh on his head.

02:39.733 --> 02:42.154
The skin and bones of all our animals are useful.

02:42.154 --> 02:43.956
Some people even eat the flesh.

02:48.179 --> 02:48.900
the world.

03:03.557 --> 03:11.121
In such a situation, if someone is in need, they can donate their eyes and other essential organs.

03:11.121 --> 03:13.742
There is nothing to worry about.

03:13.742 --> 03:19.345
Many people have said that it is not good for the body to be damaged.

03:19.345 --> 03:20.545
I agree with them.

03:28.949 --> 03:38.073
When it is physical, and it has to be destroyed, then if it comes in someone's use, then it is the best.

03:38.073 --> 03:41.154
I consider this to be good.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.636
Paapaya Parpeedanam.

03:45.636 --> 03:50.017
This is the best and the best of good deeds.

03:50.017 --> 03:58.059
That through you, someone else can see, hear, speak, live a little life.

03:58.059 --> 03:59.080
You have already left.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.120
Give a smile to someone else and leave.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.401
Give a look to someone else and leave.

04:05.401 --> 04:08.322
Then it will feel very good.

04:08.322 --> 04:09.122
Guru's blessings.

04:09.122 --> 04:10.343
Radhe Radhe.
